In this project, I explored a dataset that contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix. I used Python and the pandas library to load the data, look through it, and better understand what kind of content is available on the platform.



The dataset includes details such as whether a title is a movie or a TV show, the year it was released, its rating, and the country where it was produced. Each row in the dataset represents one title on Netflix.



The goal of this project was to practice working with real-world data by creating summaries and visualizations that help explain patterns in Netflix’s content library. Based on the analysis, it is easier to see trends such as the difference between movies and TV shows, how content is distributed over time, and which countries contribute the most titles.
